# Calculator
### Description:<br />
This program is a calculator that solves complicated expressions following the correct order of operations (solving in the order: parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division from left to right, and addition and subtraction from left to right).

### How to Gain Access to the Full Repository:<br />
I submitted this project as a part of a class at UC Santa Cruz, and am not allowed to post it publicly. If you would like to see this project, please message me on LinkedIn (at www.linkedin.com/in/amishanambiar) and I will grant you access. Thank you for your understanding.

### How to Run This Project:<br />
First, install a Python IDE. I used PyCharm for this project, but others such as IDLE or Visual Studio should work as well. Then, download all the files in the repository and open them in your IDE. Run calculator.py and type an expression in the console for the computer to solve. Run calculatorGUI.py to press buttons on a digital calculator to create an expression for the computer to solve. For this, press the equal sign at the end of the expression to get the answer and press the "c" button to clear the window before typing a new equation in.
